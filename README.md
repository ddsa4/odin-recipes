# odin-recipes

With this project I aim to use HTML skills and knowledge that I acquired while studying the Odin Project curriculum. 
This is my first project and it'll consist of a few recipes. 
Throughout the project I'll use some HTML commands that'll allow me to create lists, add text, images and links, and it'll be the first step to allow me to create a well structured website.
