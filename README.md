# odin-recipes

With this project I aim to use HTML skills and knowledge that I acquired while studying the Odin Project curriculum. 
This is my first project and it'll consist of a recipe, a mushroom recipe, "which is one of my favorites". 
Throughout the project I'll use some HTML commands that'll allow me to create lists, add text, images and links, and ultimately create a well structured website.
